    <p>As Finance Director for <a href="https://www.californiawomenslist.org/" target="_blank">California Women’s List</a>, I help lead statewide efforts to support pro-choice women running for office in California. My focus is on scaling sustainable fundraising infrastructure, expanding institutional partnerships, and shaping our 10-year strategic growth vision. I work closely with donors, sponsors, and stakeholders to power early support for candidates positioned to lead.</p>

    <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;">NextDonor <em>(Personal Prototype)</em></h3>
    <p>I built <strong>NextDonor</strong> as a self-initiated experiment to learn more about streamlining political donor targeting workflows from public databases. Most tools I’ve encountered as a fundraiser either lack flexibility or are burdened with unnecessary complexity, so I designed a lean prototype to explore how cleaner, more actionable data could be surfaced quickly from public databases.</p>
    <p><strong>Status:</strong> Personal prototype (non-commercial)<br>
    <strong>Role:</strong> Designer / Developer (built for learning)<br>
    <strong>Stack:</strong> React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL<br>

    <p><strong>The Book Stack:</strong> I read <strong>52–100 books a year</strong> and share my highlights. What started as a personal system for retaining more of what I read has become a core part of my thinking. I’ll read anything—send recs! <br>

    <p><strong>Running & Movement:</strong> Running is my favorite way to stay grounded. I’m deeply involved in LA’s fitness community—whether training, trail relays, or yoga. I’ve helped coordinate partnerships with <strong>AHA Sparkling Water</strong>, <strong>LMNT</strong>, and <strong>CBS Radford</strong> to support fitness creators across LA. <br>
