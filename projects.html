    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">A sample of work and prototypes I've built, contributed to, or currently lead—across politics, tech, and community. If anything sparks a conversation, I’d love to hear from you.</p>

      <h3>California Women’s List</h3>
      <p>As Finance Director for <a href="https://www.californiawomenslist.org/" target="_blank">California Women’s List</a>, I help lead statewide efforts to support pro-choice women running for office in California. My focus is on scaling sustainable fundraising infrastructure, expanding institutional partnerships, and shaping our 10-year strategic growth vision. I work closely with donors, sponsors, and stakeholders to power early support for candidates positioned to lead.</p>

      <h3>NextDonor <em>(Personal Prototype)</em></h3>
      <p><em>Exploring more intuitive ways to extract donor insights from public campaign finance data.</em></p>
      <p>I built <strong>NextDonor</strong> as a self-initiated experiment to learn more about streamlining political donor targeting workflows from public databases. Most tools I’ve encountered as a fundraiser either lack flexibility or are burdened with unnecessary complexity—so I designed a lean prototype to explore how cleaner, more actionable data could be surfaced quickly from public databases.</p>
      <p><strong>Status:</strong> Personal prototype (non-commercial)</p>
      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Designer / Developer (built for learning)</p>
      <p><strong>Stack:</strong> React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL</p>
      <p><strong>Curious?</strong> Always open to feedback, collaboration, or swapping notes—just <a href="mailto:katerinaioannides13@gmail.com">reach out</a>.</p>

      <h3>How I Recharge</h3>
      <p><strong>The Book Stack:</strong> I read <strong>52–100 books a year</strong> and take detailed highlights, notes, and synthesis from each one. This project started as a personal system for retaining more of what I read, but it’s grown into a practice that deeply informs my writing, product thinking, and strategy work.<br>

      <p><strong>Running & Movement:</strong> Running is my favorite way to connect with people and stay grounded. I’m actively involved in the Los Angeles fitness community—whether it’s logging long runs, coaching yoga, or supporting wellness-focused events. Some of the most meaningful conversations of my life have happened mid-run. I’ve helped coordinate partnerships and activations with brands like <strong>AHA Sparkling Water</strong>, <strong>LMNT</strong>, and <strong>CBS Radford</strong> to support fitness crews and creators across LA. I’m always open to helping facilitate partnerships, brand outreach, or community initiatives in this space.<br>
